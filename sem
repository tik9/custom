.zshenv
always sourced
often contains exported variables that should be available to other programs. For example, $PATH, $EDITOR, and $PAGER are often set in .zshenv. Also, you can set $ZDOTDIR to specify an alternative location for the rest of your zsh configuration.

.zshrc
 interactive shell configuration. You set options for the interactive shell there with the setopt and unsetopt commands. You can also load shell modules, set your history options, change your prompt, set up zle and completion, et cetera. You also set any variables that are only used in the interactive shell (e.g. $LS_COLORS).

.zlogin
sourced on the start of a login shell. This file is often used to start X using startx. Some systems start X on boot, so this file is not always very useful.

.zprofile
same as .zlogin except that it's sourced directly before .zshrc is sourced instead of directly after it.
.zprofile is meant as an alternative to `.zlogin' for ksh fans; the two are not intended to be used together, although this could certainly be done if desired."

.zlogout
sometimes used to clear and reset the terminal.

zshenv → [.zprofile falls login] → [.zshrc falls interactive] → [.zlogin falls login] → [.zlogout sometimes].
